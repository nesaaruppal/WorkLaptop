    ## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#daily
# When stock price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

#TODO 1. - Get yesterday's closing stock price. Hint: You can perform list comprehensions on Python dictionaries. e.g. [new_value for (key, value) in dictionary.items()]

yesterday_data = stock_data_list[0]
yesterday_closing_price = yesterday_data["4. close"]
print(yesterday_closing_price) 


#TODO 2. - Get the day before yesterday's closing stock price

#Increase the index because the dates are going backwards 
    # So today is "0", but yesterday is next in the list and will be "1"
day_before_yesterday_data = stock_data_list[1]
day_before_yesterday_closing_price = day_before_yesterday_data["4. close"]
print(day_before_yesterday_closing_price)


#TODO 3. - Find the positive difference between 1 and 2. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20. Hint: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_abs.asp
# abs() Function --> Return the absolute value of a number (removes minus signs before a number)
    #x = abs(-7.25)
    #x = 7.25
difference = float(yesterday_closing_price) - float(day_before_yesterday_closing_price)

#TODO 4. - Work out the percentage difference in price between closing price yesterday and closing price the day before yesterday.
diff_percent = float(positive_difference) / float(yesterday_closing_price) * 100
print(diff_percent)


#TODO 5. - If TODO4 percentage is greater than 5 then print("Get News").
    # Change "5" to a smaller number for testing but 5 for 5%
if diff_percent > 2:
    print(f"Get News! Your tesla stock")
    

    ## STEP 2: https://newsapi.org/ 
    # Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME. 

#TODO 6. - Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME.




#TODO 7. - Use Python slice operator to create a list that contains the first 3 articles. Hint: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation


    ## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
    #to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 

#TODO 8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.

#TODO 9. - Send each article as a separate message via Twilio. 



#Optional TODO: Format the message like this: 
"""
