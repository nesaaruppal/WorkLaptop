/* Wrapping Boxes within a Box 

- E.g. If you wanted an image with a caption with the same style 

- You have to use the "Content Division Element"
- HTML element
    <div></div>
    - Completely invisible
    - Whole purpose is to contain content between the opening and closing tags
        - Can contain as many elements as you like 
        - Means that we can group them into separate boxes (these are divs)
